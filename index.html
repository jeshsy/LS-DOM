        <h1>A New Model for Higher Education</h1>
        <h2>
            Lambda School invests in a small number of ambitious individuals by training them for the world's most in-demand careers.<br />
            In exchange, Lambda School graduates pay back a small percentage of their salary after they are hired.
        </h2>
        <div class="left">     
            Selection<br />
            Applicants run through a battery of tests and interviews designed to identify those with the greatest aptitude for a highly technical career.

        <div class="right">     
            Training<br />
            Once students are selected, a small class undergoes live, intensive online training designed to meet the rigorous demands of our hiring partners.

            Classroom Experience<br/>
            Lambda School's online classroom experience is the same as any physical classroom should beâ€”live students, live instructors, full interaction, pair programming, and frequent code reviews.

            Top-Down Education<br/>
            Unlike traditional Computer Science programs, Lambda School teaches computer science principles by programming. Instead of starting with theory, we start by building applications, and add on layers of algorithms, abstraction, computer architecture, and theory to make our applications better.<br/>
            You'll not only learn the practical skills required to become a software engineer, but how to think abstractly and solve problems from first principles.
